# vsndbot-Discord 

If you got there only to add it to your server, you need to host it by yourself.↓↓↓
# The only way to get this bot:
1. Create an application on Discord developer's portal and configure the bot setting
2. Install all **libraries**
3. Insert your **tokens/API keys** to bot commands
4. Read the notes

# Additional information
1. My discord - v1ss0nd
2. Commands ![z](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/v1ss0nd/vsndbot-Discord/main/help_screenshot.png)
3. I added some comments all around the code for dumbies, tried to explain everything, more info about what in bot works and what doesnt also in there.

# Notes
To use moderation and role commands you need to create a "Moderator" role (With any permissions, but the name must be "Moderator". You can change it in the code if you dont want to create any roles)
