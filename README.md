# Discord Python Bot

# The only way to get this bot:
1. Create an application on Discord's developer portal and configure the bot settings
2. Install all **libraries**
3. Insert your **tokens/API keys** to bot commands
4. Read the notes

# Additional information
1. Commands ![z](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheUltimateSoyCode/Discord-Python-Bot/main/help_screenshot.png)
2. I added some comments all around the code, tried to explain everything, more info about what works and what doesn't also in there.

# Notes
To use moderation and role commands, you need to create a "Moderator" role. (With any permissions, but the name must be "Moderator". You can change its name in the code, if you don't want to make any new roles)

# About using the code

*Do everything you want. I don't care*
